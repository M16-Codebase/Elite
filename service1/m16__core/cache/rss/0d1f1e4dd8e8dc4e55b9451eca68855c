            <p>Please share your feedback about MODX in a brief survey that should take about 10 minutes of time—unless you have lots to share.</p>
<p>We hope the survey will accomplish three key things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us better describe the benefits of MODX to newcomers or people evaluating it in plain, non-expert language,</li>
<li>Get feedback on key features that are missing or need improvement, and</li>
<li>Understand the types of organizations that currently using MODX and how they do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll use your responses as we make updates to <a href="http://modx.com">modx.com</a> and spread the word about the creative freedom MODX brings. We’ll also take your product feedback into account for future releases.</p>

          ";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1580938420;}i:2;a:12:{s:5:"title";s:37:"MODX Revolution 3.0.0-alpha2 Released";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:7:"matdave";}s:8:"category";s:13:"Announcements";s:11:"description";s:4564:"
            <p>We have released the second alpha of MODX Revolution 3.0.0. You can get it from our <a href="https://modx.com/download/prerelease">prerelease download page</a>, or if you have a MODX Cloud account, you can create an alpha2 instance to experiment with. The core team has been focusing on making sure we preserve as much backward compatibility as possible once we get to the beta releases. We appreciate all the input, including testing, bug reports, and pull requests we have gotten during the first alpha cycle.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing even more community participation as we progress to a final MODX 3 release.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>There are many great bug fixes and enhancements we incorporated since the previous alpha release. More notably, there are a few major changes that we made as a result of working to adapt extras to the new core.</p>
<h3>Improved PSR-4 Support in xPDO</h3>
<p>One significant change in xPDO 3 had to be incorporated to support custom namespaces in extras properly. Before alpha2, if you wanted to use PSR-4 namespaces MODX 3, you could not include the namespace prefix in the package name when using the setPackage or addPackage methods. If multiple packages in extras tried to follow similar conventions, they would end up with the same package name, effectively overwriting the existing package. By allowing the namespace prefix as a parameter to these methods, we can now calculate the path properly while allowing the entire namespace as the package name. Problem solved.</p>
<p>We’ll have updated documentation on this soon.</p>
<h3>Bootstrapping Component Namespaces</h3>
<p>Another problem extras were facing while trying to follow the conventions of the new core was adding custom autoloading logic when they don’t have an xPDO model. After some brainstorming, John Peca and Jason Coward came up with the idea of looking for a bootstrap file for each component namespace. In this way, we can register autoloading and handle other component-specific initialization needs when loading MODX. This approach will effectively replace the need for extension packages and could also reduce the need for service classes.</p>
<p>See the Bootstrapping Services section in the documentation covering <a href="https://docs.modx.com/3.x/en/extending-modx/namespaces">Namespaces</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Say Hello to Dependency Injection</h3>
<p>Speaking of services, we also added a more capable dependency injection container for alpha2. For those that know what dependency injection is, we have included <a href="https://pimple.symfony.com/">Pimple</a>. This simple but effective DI container from Symfony does everything we need it to do while providing backward compatibility with accessing legacy MODX services as if they are just an array. Jason wrapped it with a simple PSR-11 implementation to meet our needs, and now we can utilize this container throughout the MODX core, as well as in custom xPDO models.</p>
<p>Learn more about using the <a href="https://docs.modx.com/3.x/en/extending-modx/di-container">Dependency Injection Container</a> in the documentation.</p>
<h3>Changes to the way legacy deprecated classes are loaded</h3>
<p>The inclusion of the deprecated class aliases in the composer autoload caused several problems, so we refactored that slightly. Now it loads after the main modX class does, allowing us to make core initialization consistent across the board. Some additional legacy classes were added to the list of aliases, as well.</p>
<h3>Removal of modAction and legacy controller support</h3>
<p>Finally, we removed the long-deprecated modAction model along with legacy manager controller support. Dumping these paved the way to improve the loading of manager controllers overall. You can review the <a href="https://docs.modx.com/3.x/en/extending-modx/custom-manager-pages">Custom Manager Pages</a> documentation to learn more about these changes.</p>
<h2>What’s Next for MODX 3.0.0</h2>
<p>We are planning on just one additional alpha release cycle, and then the focus will be on locking down backward compatibility and features in preparation for a beta. As always, the more testing and other contributions we can get from the community during this process, the faster we can progress. MODX is a robust and flexible project, and, as they say, it takes a village.</p>

            <p>There is currently an active exploit of sites with an intact MODX Revolution <code>setup/</code> directory. This can give <em>anyone</em> on the internet complete access to your site and possibly your server with trivial effort. This directory should <em>never</em> be left in place once a site is installed.</p>
<p>You can check if your site is vulnerable by entering your site URL with a <code>/setup/</code> added at the end, for example:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.example.com/setup/">https://www.example.com/setup/</a></strong></p>
<p>If you see a MODX installation utility, you should log into your server via FTP or SSH <strong>immediately</strong>, and remove this directory. If your site is working as expected, your site may be safe, but please review the additional information below.</p>
<p>Using the MODX installation script above, a malicious individual can re-install MODX and point to any database they wish including remote databases. Once a site is “re-installed” they can then use the Manager’s file manager to upload other back door files to your server. This can potentially lead to more severe issues such as having the entire server <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit">rootkitted</a>, setting up spam mailers, or uploading crypto miners to take advantage of computing resources on your server.</p>
<p>If your site has been compromised or is not working correctly, and the setup folder per the above was in place, you must first re-connect your site to the correct database and server. Ask your web host or sysadmin to reset your database password and give you the new database credentials. Once you have those, update the MODX config file—by default located at <code>core/config/config.inc.php</code>—with the correct settings.</p>
<p>You should also upgrade your MODX version to the latest production release (currently 2.7.1) and upgrade all Extras if they are not current. Keeping up with updates is critical to maintaining a secure site, as it plays a key role in <a href="https://support.modx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010644353-How-Websites-Get-Hacked-and-How-to-Protect-Yourself">helping prevent sites from compromise</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, you should run a malware scanner to make sure other exploits haven’t already been uploaded to your site as described above. We have a series of articles that walks you through recovering from a site compromise, which hopefully will help in this effort:</p>

            <p>There is currently an active exploit of sites with an intact MODX Revolution <code>setup/</code> directory. This can give <em>anyone</em> on the internet complete access to your site and possibly your server with trivial effort. This directory should <em>never</em> be left in place once a site is installed.</p>
<p>You can check if your site is vulnerable by entering your site URL with a <code>/setup/</code> added at the end, for example:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.example.com/setup/">https://www.example.com/setup/</a></strong></p>
<p>If you see a MODX installation utility, you should log into your server via FTP or SSH <strong>immediately</strong>, and remove this directory. If your site is working as expected, your site may be safe, but please review the additional information below.</p>
<p>Using the MODX installation script above, a malicious individual can re-install MODX and point to any database they wish including remote databases. Once a site is “re-installed” they can then use the Manager’s file manager to upload other back door files to your server. This can potentially lead to more severe issues such as having the entire server <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit">rootkitted</a>, setting up spam mailers, or uploading crypto miners to take advantage of computing resources on your server.</p>
